# jupyter-demo

Introducing basics of Jupyter Notebook (intended to be used in
presentation / chat).

Often I need to introduce the notebook in a discussion, and everytime
I look for a simple example on my file system. This repository is
meant to be a substitute.

This can also be used to demo ipynb-file rendering on github (subdirectory
`executed-notebooks`), or to demonstrate the MyBinder service:

Examples:

Update September 2019: The manuscript *Data exploration and analysis
with Jupyter notebooks* has a reference to the [2-widgets.ipynb
example](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fangohr/jupyter-demo/master?filepath=2-widgets.ipynb).
